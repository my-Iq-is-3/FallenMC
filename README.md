#FallenMC
A unique, free-for-all pvp server that is (probably) open-source. I mean, if you're reading this, why not?
<br><br>Feel free to fork, but make sure to make a "Server" folder on your desktop with the necessary plugins (npclib, NBTAPI) inside the plugins folder, and with the server JAR (you must be running [NachoSpigot](https://github.com/CobbleSword/NachoSpigot)) placed at the root and labeled "spigot.jar" (I'm so sorry, but our dependencies storage is horrible).
